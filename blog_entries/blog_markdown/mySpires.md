This browser extension is a wonderful tool to manage your BibTeX files.
Its wonderful integration with [arXiv](arxiv.org) and [iNSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net) allows you to add references to your library:

![Save button](/blog_entries/blog_markdown/images/myspires_save_button.jpg)

and manage references with tags and comments on the fly

You can also import your current BibTeX file by copy-pasting the "BibTeX Code" in the extension website.

All of your saved resources can be synchronised on a dropbox folder and whenever you need it, you can export your library and download it as a BibTeX file.

By far one of the best tools I used when writing my PhD thesis.
